# Deployment Instructions for Enhanced Error Logging

## Summary of Changes Made

I've successfully enhanced the browser-tools-mcp to capture comprehensive error logs similar to what you see in Chrome DevTools. Here's what was implemented:

### âœ… Enhanced Error Capture
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) violations** - Now detects "Refused to execute inline script" and similar CSP errors
- **Network loading failures** - Captures 405 errors, resource loading failures
- **Security errors** - Certificate errors, mixed content warnings
- **Browser interventions** - Performance warnings, lazy loading notifications
- **Enhanced JavaScript errors** - With full stack traces and source information
- **Audit issues** - Accessibility, performance, and best practice violations

### âœ… New MCP Tools Added
- `getCSPViolations` - Specifically for Content Security Policy violations
- `getAllErrors` - Comprehensive summary of all error types

### âœ… Enhanced Data Structure
Each error now includes:
- Source type (`csp-violation`, `runtime-exception`, `network-loading-failed`, etc.)
- Full error details and stack traces
- URL and line number information
- Timestamps and categorization

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Restart the Services

To activate the new features, you need to restart both services:

```bash
# Stop any running instances first
# Then restart the browser-tools-server
cd browser-tools-server
npm start

# In a new terminal, restart the MCP server
cd browser-tools-mcp
npm start
```

### 2. Reload the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Find "BrowserTools MCP" extension
4. Click the reload button (ðŸ”„) to reload the extension with the new code

### 3. Test the Enhanced Functionality

Test with Real Websites
1. Navigate to a website with CSP errors (like the ponyclub.gr site you mentioned)
2. Open Chrome DevTools
3. Use the enhanced MCP tools to capture errors

### 4. Using the New Tools

Once restarted, you'll have access to these new tools:

```bash
# Get comprehensive error summary (NEW)
mcp_getAllErrors

# Get CSP violations specifically (NEW)
mcp_getCSPViolations

# Enhanced console errors (now captures much more)
mcp_getConsoleErrors

# Regular console logs (enhanced with metadata)
mcp_getConsoleLogs
```

## Expected Results

### Before Enhancement
You were only seeing basic console.log messages like:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "console-log",
    "level": "log",
    "message": "Basic console message",
    "timestamp": 1234567890
  }
]
```

### After Enhancement
You'll now see comprehensive error logs like:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "console-error",
    "level": "error",
    "message": "Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self'\"",
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "source": "csp-violation",
    "url": "https://example.com/page",
    "lineNumber": 42,
    "isCSPViolation": true,
    "details": {
      "level": "error",
      "text": "Full error details...",
      "source": "security"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "console-error",
    "level": "error",
    "message": "Network loading failed: 405 Method Not Allowed",
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "source": "network-loading-failed",
    "url": "https://example.com/api/endpoint",
    "details": {
      "errorText": "Method Not Allowed",
      "type": "network"
    }
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See New Tools
- Make sure both services are fully restarted
- Check that the MCP server is running without errors
- Verify the browser-tools-server is discoverable

### If You Don't See Enhanced Error Data
- Ensure Chrome DevTools is open (required for the extension to work)
- Check that the Chrome extension was reloaded
- Navigate to a page with known errors to test

### If Errors Still Look Basic
- Verify the Chrome extension files were updated correctly
- Check the browser console for any extension errors
- Make sure you're using Chrome (not Firefox/Safari)

## Validation

To verify the enhanced error logging is working:

1. Navigate to a website with CSP violations
2. Open Chrome DevTools Console and note the errors you see
3. Use `mcp_getConsoleErrors` to capture the same errors
4. Compare - you should now see similar comprehensive error information in both places

The enhanced browser-tools-mcp should now capture the same types of detailed errors you see in Chrome DevTools, including CSP violations, network failures, and security warnings.

## Performance Note

The enhanced error logging captures more data but includes automatic limits to prevent memory issues. Error logs are capped at 50 entries by default and older entries are automatically removed when the limit is reached.
